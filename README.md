# BetterLoadingScreen [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Grummus/BetterLoadingScreen/total.svg)]()
### Exactly what it says it is

Replaces the default VRChat world loading screen with something similar to the old warp tunnel

Still Under Construction

## Planned Features:
 - Ability to customize
 - Option to toggle warp tunnel effect and other things
 - Gotta find that original skybox texture
 - Get the old UI working!
