# NoMenuMusic

### Also exactly what it says it is

It literally just removes the music from the login & loading menus.
Ripped apart and sewn back together from [Grummus/BetterLoadingScreen](https://github.com/Grummus/BetterLoadingScreen)

~~Still Under Construction~~ is it really though?

## Planned Features:

 - âœ” Option to toggle warp tunnel effect and other things
 - Get the old UI working!
