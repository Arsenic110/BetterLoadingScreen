# NoMenuMusic

### Also exactly what it says it is

It literally just removes the music from the login & loading menus, and doesnt touch anything else.
Inspired by every friday night when my music would conflict with the menus.
  
Ripped apart and sewn back together from [Grummus/BetterLoadingScreen](https://github.com/Grummus/BetterLoadingScreen)!

~~Still Under Construction~~ is it really though?

## Other

Right now I dont have much plans to maintain this with every VRChat update, but if it breaks and it annoys me again Ill definitely try :3
Big thanks to Grummus, AAMBIENTT, and thetrueyoshifan, original authors of the code.  
By the way, the original repository does not have license. Ill go ahead and include a standard MIT license to this one, though.
